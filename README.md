# Social Media Mining for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) in Cyber Threat Detection

## Introduction

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) leverages publicly available data to enhance cyber threat detection and situational awareness. Social media mining—extracting actionable intelligence from social networks—has become crucial for identifying vulnerabilities, threat actors, and cyber attack patterns. This report provides a structured review of key tools, including Shodan, Maltego, Gephi, and similar platforms, focusing on their capabilities, use cases, advantages, disadvantages, pricing models, and applicability to cyber defense.
